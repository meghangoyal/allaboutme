    <h4>I began taking computer science classes last year, in ninth grade. I took a 3D printing class last year, and made a lot of cool objects including a keychain and shapes. This school year, I signed up for a web design class. I plan on taking many more computer science glasses i nthe future as well.</h4>

    <h4>The first school I went to was Josephy Bruno Montessori Academy, from pre-school to first grade. I transferred to Liberty Park Middle School in second grade, but moved to Highlands Day School halfway through the school year. I moved to Altamont in fifth grade, and I plan on staying here for the remainder of high school.</h4>
